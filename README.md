## React Fundamental Concepts Used

This project utilizes the following React concepts:
- React Router for routing between different pages (Home, Contact, Dashboard, FAQ)
- React Functional Components
- React State and Props for managing component data
- React Context API for global state management (Cart, Wishlist)
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing component state and side effects
- Event handling for user interactions (adding to cart, adding to wishlist)

## Data Handling and Management

For handling and managing data, the following tools were used:
- **Context API**: Used for managing global state across components like Cart and Wishlist.
- **Local Storage**: Data like the user's cart and wishlist are saved to the browser's local storage, so it persists even after the user refreshes the page.
